    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I taught myself to play guitar which took a great deal of dedication and active learning to be competent.<br> Once I grew in skill and confidence I began playing guitar at a care home which primarily looked after sufferers of dementia.</p>
    <p>Learning this skill, I believe, will help me become a better programmer.<br> It forced me to try new things, knowing I would get them wrong, but eventually with enough practice, I would improve.
    <br>
Since I was self-taught it also forced me to rely on myself for answers and I had to be proactive in my learning.<br> I would set myself goals each week, such as learning a new song or practising a scale.<br></p>  
    <p>
      I also discovered that the biggest disadvantage of being self-taught is not having a person of expertise to support me during my learning.<br>
      This was the fundamental reason for applying for the Founders and Coders programme.<br>
      The programme focusses on a collaborative nature of learning, but with on hand expert support.<br> I feel this is the best way to learn how to become a developer.
